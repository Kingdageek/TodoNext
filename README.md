## Simple Todo List App with Next.js and React
---
This was done to satisfy the **Enye** Software Development program's [first requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZUyi4bbUDBui6fbVmVeqD8PqUS6gTbekftKLooPwZlk/edit) and the [second requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iuKg5mvCeVPwQ7yGhGU1I9hyZUF64k0hTyYlgWTAYPM/edit), after spending like 9 hours on [codecademy](https://codecademy.org). So, the major focus wasn't to follow industry-standard practices, it was just to get something done.

There's like literally no **styling**, maybe styling would be added later.

So, clone the repo and run `npm install` to get the required packages downloaded to your computer then run `npm run dev` to start up the development server.

*components/TodoForm.js* contains the `TodoForm` Component that just displays the form to enter a Todo, *components/TodoTasks.js* contains the `TodoTasks` component that displays all the available Todos, *pages/index.js* contains the `Index` component that brings them together and works the magic.
